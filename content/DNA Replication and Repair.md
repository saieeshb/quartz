# DNA Polymerase
1. Before replication begins, an RNA primer is laid on a part of a strand of the DNA to be replicated.
2. The DNA Polymerase **always** **reads** **3' to 5'** on the DNA strand no matter what. 
3. The DNA Polymerase **always adds to the 3' end** of the Primer.
4. The DNA Polymerase needs all 4 deoxytriphosphates (dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP) to add to the 3' end. It does not just add up deoxymonophosphates like legs
