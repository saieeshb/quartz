```ad-tip
Don't spend your time memorizing structures of the bases altogether. Try to remember the differences between them instead.

```

They are classified as [[content/gene/Purines]] and [[content/gene/Pyrimidines]].

+ Purines are Adenine and Guanine. (**Pu**re **a**s **G**old)
+ Pyrimidines are Cytosine, Uracil and Thymosine (**CUT**)
+ Purines have a bigger structure, 2 rings but a smaller name. 
+ Pyrimidines have a smaller structure, 1 ring, but a longer name.
