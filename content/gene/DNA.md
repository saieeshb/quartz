# DNA
## Types of DNA:
### Double Stranded DNA
![[content/Images/dnastructure.png]]
+ In  the deoxyribose sugar, 
	+ 1' carbon is connected to the Nitrogen Base
	+ 2' is not connected to a hydroxyl moiety
	+ 5' is connected to a phosphate group
	+ 3' is connected to hydroxy moiety to which the phosphate below attaches to.
+ The phosphate-sugar-phosphate makes up the "backbone" of the DNA
+ Due to it's 5' phosphate and 3' hydroxl moieties at the end we can define a **polarity** to a strand of DNA.
+ The sequence of the bases is what makes the difference between two different person's DNA.
+ Two nucleotides are connected by a **Phosphodiester Bond (PDE)**

## Properties of dsDNA
+ DNA is **Antiparallel**, meaning that 5' phosphate is base paired with 3' hydroxyl at an end.
+ DNA is also **Complimentary**, meaning that A's always base pair with T's and G's always pair with C's
### Different bonds in DNA
+ A's and T's bond with *two* hydrogen bonds.
+ G's and C's bond with *three* hydrogen bonds.
+ Hence, the ==G-C bond is stronger than the A-T bond.==
+ Therefore, dsDNA with more G-C bonds would take more energy to melt and therefore have higher melting points.
---
### Convention to read
 + We read DNA from 5' to 3' 
 + For example, in [this](obsidian://open?vault=Biochem&file=Pasted%20image%2020221010175758.png) image, we would read it as 5'-GTCA-3'
 + It could be also read as 5'-GpTpCpAp-3' where the P's stand for the phosphates in between the sugars.
 + If you wanted to read it from 3' to 5' you would read it as 3'-ACTG-5'
 + All three mentioned above represent the same DNA.

# Chargaff's Rules
**The amount of A's would be equal to the number of Ts(Us) and the number of G's are equal to the number of C's**
**The number of purines and pyrimidines are equal**

```ad-example
**Suppose a sample of dsDNA has 35% of A. What is the % of C?**

*Ans: 15%*

If A is 35% then T has to be 35%, so together they make 70% and the remaining 30% has to be G and C together, since G and C are equal, both G and C have to be 15% each.
```

```ad-tip
A shortcut to problems like this is to multiply the given %, subtract it from 100 and divide it by 2.

```

```ad-attention
 If you can't seem to apply Chargaff's rules to a strand of DNA. It may be **ssDNA** you're dealing with.

```

# DNA and it double-helix structure
+ Most DNA in our body is **B-DNA** which means it is **Right-handed DNA**.
+ ![[content/Images/minor_groove01.jpg]]
+ It has two grooves named Major Groove and Minor Groove
+ **10 bases** make up one complete turn which measures **34 A**
+ There are enzymes that can change how many bases make up a turn, i.e. relax or compress the DNA.
+  The stacking of the DNA causes hydrophobic interactions between the adjacent base pair hydrogen bonds resulting in greater stability.

# DNA Denaturation
+ The cleavage of the strands of a dsDNA to create two seperate ssDNA strands is called DNA Denaturation
+ Denaturation is caused through Heat.
+ Renaturation or Annealing is caused when seperated strands of complimentary DNA are allowed to cooldown causing them to bond again. Yep.
