# The Central Dogma
## Replication and Transcription differ:

| How?                   | Replication     | Transcription             |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Nucleic Acid           | [[notes/DNA]] is formed   | RNA is formed             |
| Length of Nucleic Acid | Larger          | Much, much smaller        |
| Enzymes                | DNA polymerase  | RNA polymerase            |
| Phases of cell cycle   | Only in S phase | All throughout Interphase |
|                        |                 |                           |

> Transcription and Translation does **NOT** take place during M phase.

+ ***Growth factors*** give the signal for the cell to go from G<sub>1</sub> to S phase.

# Chemotherapeutic Agents that target specific parts of the cell cycle

| Phase                  | Factor                              | Uses                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| S phase                | 5-Fluorouracil, Methotrexate        | 5-fluorouracil blocks the enzyme Thymidylate synthase which converts dUMP to dTMP. Used to treat cancer. **Methotrexate** is also used to treat cancer and some dermatalogical issues.            |
| G<sub>2</sub> phase    | Bleomycin                           | Used to treat Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Bleomycin toxicity also causes Pulmonnary Fibrosis.                                                                                                              |
| M phase                | Paclitaxel, Vincristine, Vinblastin | Prevents the microtubules from assembling. Therefore causeing the mitotic spindle to fall apart. Effectively blocks mitosis.                                                                       |
| Non cell-cyle specific | Cyclophosphamide and Cisplatin      | Cyclophosphamid is used for a number of leukimias. Blocks the cell cycle altogether. Doesn't inhibit any particular phase. Platinum based treatments such as Cisplatin also cause the same effect. |

# Gene Expression vs DNA Replication
| Gene Expression                                                                                                            | DNA Replication                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Produces proteins required. Proteins expressed **differ between tissues**                                                  | Chromosomes duplicated. **Same for ALL tissues.**                                   |
| Only a segment of the total is transcribed and hence is smaller. (10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> nucleotide pairs long.) | **Entire DNA is replicated** Hence its significantly longer. 10<sup>8</sup> approx. |
| Transcription occurs all through Interphase. Does **NOT occur in mitosis**                                                 | Occurs during only S phase.                                                         |
| Translation occurs in cytoplasm.                                                                                           | Replication occurs in nucleus.                                                      |
|                                                                                                                            |                                                                                     |
