- Nucleosomes are comprised of DNA surrounding proteins termed [[notes/Histones]].
- Histones are +vely charged while DNA is negatively charged.
-   They contain: 
	- H1
	- H2A
	- H2B
	- H3
	- H4
- There is only one copy of H1 but the rest of them are present in two copies.
- Nucleosome is an Octamer. 
	- 8 proteins make up a nucleosome.

>[!tip]  Nuclesomes are also called "10 Nanometer chromatids."

- H1 is present  outside the nucleosome.
	- It helps in condensing of the Nucleosome.
+ As shown in the figure above the nucleosomes are much loosely packed without H1 present.
