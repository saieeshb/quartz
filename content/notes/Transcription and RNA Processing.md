# RNA Polymerase
- The DNA Polymerase identifies the RNA Primer as its cue to start replicating the strand of DNA.
- In the case of RNA Polymerase, it identifies the promoter present before the gene.
- It finds and binds to the promoter sequence first.
- It **never** binds to the gene first.

- The gene is dsDNA but only one strand is used as the template.
	- The strand of DNA which is used as the template is known as the **template strand.**
		- This strand is complementary to the mRNA being made.
	- The strand of DNA which is not used is known as the **Coding strand.**
		- This strand is identical to the mRNA being made except the T/U.
		- Use this info to exploit lol.
- The DNA is read 3' to 5' and the mRNA is made 5' to 3'.
- Transcription gives rise to 
	- mRNA - made at euchromatin
	- tRNA - made at euchromatin
	- rRNA - most of it is made in the nucleolus

- The N-terminus and C-terminus are the two ends of the protein.
>[!tip] The coding strand is called the coding strand since it "codes" for the protein in the end. Coding strand is the one which is reported in databases.

> The answer is E. RNA is antiparallel and complementary to the template strand. Also remember that, by convention, all base sequences are written in the 5′ to 3′ direction regardless of the direction in which the sequence may actually be used in the cell.
Approach:
• Cross out any option with a T (RNA has U).
• Look at the 5′ end of DNA (T in this case).
• What is the complement of this base? (A)
Examine the options given. A correct option will have the complement (A in this example) at the 3′ end. Repeat the procedure for the 3′ end of the DNA. This will usually leave only one or two options.
