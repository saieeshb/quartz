>[!tip]  These are the smallest RNAs

- These have a clover leaf structure.
- All tRNA's have the same structure but they have different sequences.

## tRNA Functions
- Picks up amino acid.
- Recognizes the codon on the mRNA.

## tRNA structure
1. The arms with the loops contain modified bases.
	1. The loop arm toward the 3' end has a PSI base and a Thymine base even though it is made of RNA.
	2. The arms are used to sit in the ribosome and not fall out.
2. All tRNAs have the same **CCA sequence**  at the 3' end.
	1. The A has a OH attached to it at the 3' end via covalent bond.
3. At the bottom of the tRNA is the anticodon.
	1. It is used to base pair to the codon in the mRNA.
	2. It is antiparallel and complimentary.
