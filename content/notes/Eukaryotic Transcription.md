# Eukaryotic Transcription
![[Images/Pasted image 20221112143159.png]]

>[!tip]  Only about 1.5% percent of our chromosomal DNA actually codes for a protein.

- This means each gene is more widely spaced.
- Each  gene has its own promoter.
- Exon is the Expressed part
- Introns are the intervening part.
1. No Operons in eukaryotic transcriptions. These only exist in prokaryotic organisms.
	1. This is because we have monocistronic genes.
2. RNA Polymerase binds to the Promoter and starts transcripting.
3. Intron are intervening sequences that are spliced away later after transcription.
4.  Unlike the prokaryotes, most genes in the eukaryotes don't cause a GC Stem loop. 
5. Transcriptional processing occurs. ![[Images/Pasted image 20221114133347.png]]
	1. An enzyme adds Methyl-G cap at the 5' end. 
		1. It is **co-transcriptional** meaning that it occurs simultaneosly while RNA Polymerase is transcribing the DNA itself.
	2. A couple of enzymes add the Poly-A tail to the Pre-mRNA to the 3' end.
		1. It is **post-transcriptional** meaning that it occurs after the RNA Polymerase is done transcribing.
		2. Obv it would be post-transcriptional because, you can only add it to the 3' end if the transcription is over in the first place.
	3. Splicing occurs removing the introns.
		1. Spliceosomes aka snRNA splice out the intron by looping the 5' splice donor site and the 3' splice acceptor site, causing them to base  pair and then scissoring off the loop / lariat.
		2. It is **post-transcriptional** for obvious reasons.
		3. There are many diseases caused due to incorrect splicing. 
			1. In beta-thalasemia, there is a mutation in the splice donore site of the first intron which causes the intron not to be removed.
			2. Another example is [[notes/Marfan syndrome]], and [[notes/Tay-Sachs Syndrome]]
			3. All the above occurs inside the nucleus and upto this point is named hnRNA.
			4. After splicing, it is termed as mature RNA named Messenger RNA aka mRNA.
6.  Ribosomes recognize the 7 Methyl G cap as a binding site to jump on and start translating the mRNA.

>[!faq] Sometimes some diseases can be caused due to mutations of the promoter of the gene instead of the gene itself. Hence it can cause the same issue. This can be seen in Osteogenesis Imperfecta.
