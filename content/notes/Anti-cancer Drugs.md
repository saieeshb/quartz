title: "Anti-cancer Drugs"

- Anti-cancer drugs such as Etoposide and Teniposide prevent cancer cells from replicating.
- This is possible as these drugs inhibit the activity of [[notes/DNA Gyrase]] in ***Eukaryotes.***
- These drugs also have side-effects.

>[!example] These include but not only:
>
> Hair loss, GI Tract Problems, Bleeding, Bruising, etc.

>[!warning]- If both the cancer cells and the normal cells both have DNA Gyrase, why aren't the drugs affecting all the normal cells as well?
>
> Most of the normal cells in human body are in G<sub>0</sub> phase. Which means, that DNA Gyrase is not in use as the cells are not dividing. The cells which are affected are the cancer cells and the cells in the G<sub>1</sub> phase, such as Follicle cells, GI cells and others. Hence these G<sub>1</sub> cells are also affected and hence represent themselves as side effects; Follicle cells = Hair loss, GI cells = GI tract problems, etc.
