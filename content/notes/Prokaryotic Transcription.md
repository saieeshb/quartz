# UTR
- Stands for untranslated region.
- Not all of the mRNA contains info to code for protein.
- Two stretches of UTR are present at both the 5' end and the 3' end.

  1. Operon
	  1. These are polygene areas/ polycistronic messengers.
	  2. Microbes have polygene regions.
  2. Promoter
	  1. Negative numbered nucleotides refer to nucleotides of the promoter regions while positive nucleotides refer to the nucleotides of the gene region.
  3. No exons or introns in prokaryotes.
  4. Somewhere at the 3' end, a stretch of Gs and Cs are formed which form the stem-loop sequence.
	  1. The Gs and Cs bind to each other creating the stem-loop sequence shown above.
	  2. The stem loop (being big) blocks the RNA Polymerase from continuing to transcribe, hence effectively ending the process of transcription.
  5. No transcriptional processing happens in prokaryotes.

	  2. A bunch of genes can have a single promoter and terminator.
  6. Ribosomes bind to the **Shine-Dalgarno** sequence to start translating.
	  1. Each gene is translated independently.

>[!tip] Quinolones are used to inhibit replication and **NOT** transcription or translation.

# Eukaryotic Transcription
![[Images/Pasted image 20221112143159.png]]

>[!tip]  Only about 1.5% percent of our chromosomal DNA actually codes for a protein.

- This means each gene is more widely spaced.
- Each  gene has its own promoter.
- Exon is the Expressed part
- Introns are the intervening part.
1. No Operons in eukaryotic transcriptions. These only exist in prokaryotic organisms.
	1. This is because we have monocistronic genes.
2. RNA Polymerase binds to the Promoter and starts transcripting.
3. Intron are intervening sequences that are spliced away later after transcription.
4.  Unlike the prokaryotes, most genes in the eukaryotes don't cause a GC Stem loop.

>It blocks RNA Polymerase in Eukaryotes hence, you can't produce protein and you die. lul

>[!faq] Sometimes some diseases can be caused due to mutations of the promoter of the gene instead of the gene itself. Hence it can cause the same issue. This can be seen in OI.
