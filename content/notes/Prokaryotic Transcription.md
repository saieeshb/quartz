# UTR
- Stands for untranslated region.
- Not all of the mRNA contains info to code for protein.
- Two stretches of UTR are present at both the 5' end and the 3' end.

  1. Operon
	  1. These are polygene areas/ polycistronic messengers.
	  2. Microbes have polygene regions.
  2. Promoter
	  1. Negative numbered nucleotides refer to nucleotides of the promoter regions while positive nucleotides refer to the nucleotides of the gene region.
  3. No exons or introns in prokaryotes.
  4. Somewhere at the 3' end, a stretch of Gs and Cs are formed which form the stem-loop sequence.
	  1. The Gs and Cs bind to each other creating the stem-loop sequence shown above.
	  2. The stem loop (being big) blocks the RNA Polymerase from continuing to transcribe, hence effectively ending the process of transcription.
  5. No transcriptional processing happens in prokaryotes.

	  2. A bunch of genes can have a single promoter and terminator.
  6. Ribosomes bind to the **Shine-Dalgarno** sequence to start translating.
	  1. Each ribosome translates a different gene.
