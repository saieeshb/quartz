- This is the reason we have only about 20,000 genes, but we have over 100k different types of proteins in each cell.
---
## Mechanism
- This is possible due to the ability to splice introns in a different way based upon the requirement. WOW
- In the above image to get mRNA 1, we could loop the 5' and 3' donor and acceptor sites of the Intron 1 and remove it and then, loop the 5' donor site of the Intron 2 with the 3' acceptor site of Intron 3 to effectively remove the Exon 3 along with the introns 2 and 3.
- By doing the latter process mentioned above but with Introns 1 and 2, we can obtain the mRNA 2 variation.

## Results
- This hence creates multiple types of proteins from the same gene.
- They proteins will be related but not identical to each other.
>[!example] Examples of this are:
>
>**Membrane Ig vs Secreted Ig**
>	They both are related but not identical to each other in the fact that one is membrane bound while the other one is secreted outside.
>
> **Different Tropomyosin Variants in the muscle**
> 
> **Dopamine receptors in brain**

>[!faq] Over 60% of our RNA produced undergoes alternative splicing.
