- rRNAs or ribosomal RNAs are the most abundant RNAs.

- In [[notes/Prokaryotic Transcription]] the smaller subunit, 30s recognizes the Shine Delgarno sequence.
- In [[notes/Eukaryotic Transcription]] the smaller subunit, 40s recognizes the 7 methyl G cap.
>[!error] Shiga Toxins or Vero Toxins cleave the 28S rRNA on the larger subunit of the ribosome hence halting it's function.
