- From the normal double helix structure, addition of the [[Genetics/Histones]] proteins aside the H1 protein (H2A, H2B, H3, H4) causes the second stage shown above named as 10nm chromatin also known as **nucleosomes**. 
	- They are now loosely condensed.
- Upon adding the H1 protein, the nucleosomes are condensed even more forming **nucleofilaments** or 30nm chromatin.
- Upon addition of certain **scaffloding proteins** it undergoes even more condensation.
- Upto this point, all these DNA are termed as **Euchromatin**.
- With the addition of some higher order proteins, the DNA can be packed even more into **Heterochromatin.** 
	- At this point none of the DNA is exposed and all of it surrounded by proteins.

>[!NOTE]-  Interesting point about  chromosomes
>If a chromosome was scanned from top to bottom, it would show all of the above phases of DNA all the way from double helix to Heterochromatin at different locations or **Domains** spread throughout the chromosome.

- Euchromatin is said to be light-staining while Heterochromatin is dark-staining.
