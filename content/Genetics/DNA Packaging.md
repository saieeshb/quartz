- From the normal double helix structure, addition of the [[Genetics/Histones]] proteins aside the H1 protein (H2A, H2B, H3, H4) causes the second stage shown above named as 10nm chromatin also known as **nucleosomes**. 
	- They are now loosely condensed.
- Upon adding the H1 protein, the nucleosomes are condensed even more forming **nucleofilaments** or 30nm chromatin.
- Upon addition of certain **scaffloding proteins** it undergoes even more condensation.
- Upto this point, all these DNA are termed as
