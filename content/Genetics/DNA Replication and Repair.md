# DNA vs RNA Polymerases
 
- - -
## DNA Polymerase
1. Before replication begins, an RNA primer is laid on a part of a strand of the DNA to be replicated.
2. The DNA Polymerase **always** **reads** **3' to 5'** on the DNA strand no matter what. 
3. The DNA Polymerase **always adds to the 3' end** of the Primer.
4. The DNA Polymerase needs all 4 deoxytriphosphates (dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP) to add to the 3' end. 
	1. It does not just add up deoxymonophosphates like legos. 
	2. The remaining 2 phosphates are removed as inorganic pyro phosphates. (PPi)
5.  Due to the ability of DNA Polymerase to proofread, in the case of making an error while adding the nucleotides, as shown in the above figure, it pauses, checks and effectively removes the irregularly placed base. 
	1. This is possible due to DNA Polymerase having **3' exonuclease** activity and therefore removing the nucleotide.
6. DNA Polymerase carries out *High-Fidelity DNA Synthesis.*

## RNA Polymerase
1. Unlike DNA Polymerase, the RNA Polymerase does not require a primer to start the process of transcription.
2. Just like the DNA Polymerase, it reads the strand of DNA from 3' to 5' as well.
3. Adds nucleotides from 5' to 3'.
4. Just like the DNA Polymerase it also needs triphosphates instead of monophosphates.
5. Unlike the DNA Polymerase, the RNA Polymerase does not have the ability to proofread and correct errors in polymerisation.
6. RNA Polymerase carries out *Low-fidelity RNA Synthesis.*

>[!question]- How does the RNA Polymerase know where the gene required for transcription is, without having a primer like DNA Polymerase has???
