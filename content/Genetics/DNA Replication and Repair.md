# DNA vs RNA Polymerases
 
- - -
## DNA Polymerase
1. Before replication begins, an RNA primer is laid on a part of a strand of the DNA to be replicated.
2. The DNA Polymerase **always** **reads** **3' to 5'** on the DNA strand, no matter what. 
3. The DNA Polymerase **always adds to the 3' end** of the Primer.
4. The DNA Polymerase needs all 4 deoxytriphosphates (dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP) to add to the 3' end. 
	1. It does not just add up deoxymonophosphates like legos. 
	2. The remaining 2 phosphates are removed as inorganic pyro phosphates. (PPi)
5.  Due to the ability of DNA Polymerase to proofread, in the case of making an error while adding the nucleotides, as shown in the above figure, it pauses, checks and effectively removes the irregularly placed base. 
	1. This is possible due to DNA Polymerase having **3' exonuclease** activity and therefore removing the nucleotide.
6. DNA Polymerase carries out *High-Fidelity DNA Synthesis.*
   >[!NOTE]- DNA Polymerase has **High Fidelity** *NOT* **Perfect Fidelity** hence mutations still *do* occur. 
>If it were perfect, we would've had no mutatory genetic diseases at all.

## RNA Polymerase
1. Unlike DNA Polymerase, the RNA Polymerase does not require a primer to start the process of transcription.
2. Just like the DNA Polymerase, it reads the strand of DNA from 3' to 5' as well.
3. Adds nucleotides from 5' to 3'
4. Just like the DNA Polymerase, it also needs triphosphates instead of monophosphates.
5. Unlike the DNA Polymerase, the RNA Polymerase does not have the ability to proofread and correct errors in polymerisation.
6. RNA Polymerase carries out *Low-fidelity RNA Synthesis.*

>[!error]- Why does it not matter that RNA Polymerase does not have correction and proofreading abilities?
> The RNA being made has a short half life. The scale that it is being made on is also very small. It doesn't matter that one of probably a thousand or a million cells producing the same protein is erroneous. It also isn't inherited like DNA.

>[!question]- Does the Reverse Transcriptase located in HIV require a primer?
> **YES.** Since the material being made is DNA, Reverse Transcriptase is a type of DNA Polymerase and hence requires a primer.

>[!question]- How does the RNA Polymerase know where the gene required for transcription is, without having a primer like DNA Polymerase has???

## DNA Repair
![[Images/Pasted image 20221102195107.png]]
1. Thymine dimers form due to UV Radiation. This is fixed by:
	1. [[Genetics/Excision Endonuclease]] removing the dimer.
	2. DNA Polymerase and Ligase adding in the new bases and ligating them respectively.
2. Mismatched Bases are caused due to DNA Replication errors. They are fixed by:
	1. A pair of genes, hMSH2 and hMLH1 in which one finds the error and the other excises it help remove the wrong bases.
	2. Just like for the Thymine dimers, correct bases are added and joined together by DNA Polymerase and Ligase.
3. Cytosine deamination forms Uracil. This is caused due to spontaneous heat or nitrates. 
	1. The uracil is removed by Uracil Glycosylase AP endonuclease. Since uracil should not exist in DNA.

>[!faq]- Does any repair occur in the S-phase?
> Yes, DNA Polymerase has 3' exonuclease activity which it uses to remove mismatched bases.
> >[!warning]- Then what does the 5' exonuclease do?
> >It removes the RNA Primer.

## Tumor Supressor Genes and DNA Repair
- The **p53 gene** encodes a protein of molecular weight 53, which guards the boundary of the G<sub>1</sub> and S phase.
	- If the cell in the G<sub>1</sub> phase has damaged DNA, it does not allow the cell to enter the S phase.
	- It does this by inducing apoptosis.
	- It hence supresses tumor formation.

>[!warning] Mutation of the p53 gene causes the Li Fraumel syndrome and many solid tumors.
