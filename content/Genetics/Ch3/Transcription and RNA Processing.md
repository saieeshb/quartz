# RNA Polymerase
- The DNA Polymerase identifies the RNA Primer as its cue to start replicating the strand of DNA.
- In the case of RNA Polymerase, it identifies the promoter present before the gene.
- It finds and binds to the promoter sequence first.
- It **never** binds to the gene first.

- The gene is dsDNA but only one strand is used as the template.
	- The strand of DNA which is used as the template is known as the **template strand.**
		- This strand is complementary to the mRNA being made.
	- The strand of DNA which is not used is known as the **Coding strand.**
		- This strand is identical to the mRNA being made except the T/U.
- The DNA is read 3' to 5' and the mRNA is made 5' to 3'.
- Transcription gives rise to 
	- mRNA - made at euchromatin
	- tRNA - made at euchromatin
	- rRNA - most of it is made in the nucleolus
