# Telomerase
- Telomerase finishes the job DNA Polymerase started. 
- It synthesises the ends of the chromosomes, known as telomeres.

>[!tip] Telomerase has reverse transcriptase activity.

- Cells that grow and divide rapidly have **increased activity of telomerase.**
	- These may include normal ones like stem cells which grow and divide rapidly in the embryo stage.
	- These can also be cancer cells, since they too grow at uncontrollable rates.

>[!faq] People diagnosed with [[Genetics/Progeria]] have *decreased* activity of telomerase in their cells.
