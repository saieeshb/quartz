title: "DNA Gyrase"
---
- DNA Gyrase or DNA topoisomerase II helps in relaxation of the overtightened DNA (or) removal of positive supercoils so that it/they can be read and replicated.
- [[Genetics/Fluoroquinones]] target and inhibit gyrase and hence prevent replication in prokaryotes.
- Similarly for Eukaryotes, **Etoposide and Teniposide** inhibit the DNA Topoisomerase II present in Eukaryotes and help prevent the growth of Cancer cells.
- The DNA Gyrase in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the same.
