title: "Anti-cancer Drugs"
---
- Anti-cancer drugs such as Etoposide and Teniposide prevent cancer cells from replicating.
- This is possible as these drugs inhibit the activity of [[Genetics/DNA Gyrase]] in ***Eukaryotes.***
- These drugs also have side-effects.

>[!example] These include but not only:
> Hair loss, GI Tract Problems, Bleeding, Bruising, etc.

>[!warning]- If both the cancer cells and the normal cells both have DNA Gyrase, why aren't the drugs affecting all the normal cells as well?
> Most of the normal cells in human body are in G<sub>0<sub>phase.
