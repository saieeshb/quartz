# UTR
- Stands for untranslated region.
- Not all of the mRNA contains info to code for protein.
- Two stretches of UTR are present at both the 5' end and the 3' end.

  1. Operon
	  1. These are polygene areas/ polycistronic messengers.
	  2. Microbes have polygene regions.
  2. Promoter
	  1. Negative numbered nucleotides refer to nucleotides of the promoter regions while positive nucleotides refer to the nucleotides of the gene region.
  3. No exons or introns in prokaryotes.
  4. Somewhere at the 3' end, a strech of Gs and Cs are formed which form the stem-loop sequence.
	  1. The Gs and Cs bind to each other creating the stem-loop sequence shown above.
	  2. The stem loop (being big) blocks the RNA Polymerase from continu
