>[!tip] 
Don't spend your time memorizing structures of the bases altogether. Try to remember the differences between them instead.


They are classified as [[Basics/Purines]] and [[Basics/Pyrimidines]]

+ Purines are Adenine and Guanine. (**Pu**re **a**s **G**old)
+ Pyrimidines are Cytosine, Uracil and Thymosine (**CUT**)
+ Purines have a bigger structure, 2 rings but a smaller name. 
+ Pyrimidines have a smaller structure, 1 ring, but a longer name.
