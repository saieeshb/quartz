- This is the reason we have only about 20,000 genes, but we have over 100k different types of proteins in each cell.

## Mechanism
- This is possible due to the ability to splice introns in a different way based upon the requirement.
- In the above image to get mRNA 1, we could loop the 5' and 3' donor and acceptor sites of the Intron 1 and remove it and then, loop the 5' donor site of the Intron 2 with the 3' acceptor site of Intron 3 to effectively remove the Exon 3 along with the introns 2 and 3.
- By doing the latter process mentioned above but with Introns 1 and 2, we can obtain the mRNA 2 variation.
